## GA WDI Project 3
> Building our own API

### Technical Requirements

#### Back-end

- Your API includes at least 2 models, one of which may be a user
- Your models include at least one association
- Your API has RESTful routes as appropriate

---

#### Front-end

- Your app provides a reasonable user experience
- Your view(s) includes at least one AJAX request that allows a user to somehow interact with the API
- Your code, as rendered in the browser, passes a [CSS validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and an [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

---

#### Code Quality

Your code follows the styles we've covered in class: DRY, easy to read,
well-commented.

---

#### Submission

- One person from your team should file an issue on the [pbj-project3-gallery repo](https://github.com/ga-dc/pbj-project3-gallery). The issue should contain:
  - A link to **your group's main Github repo**.
  - At least 3 specific areas of code on which you would like targeted feedback (agree on these as a team)
  - Any other comments or questions
- Your submitted Github repository includes a `planning` folder that contains:
  - Evidence of planning (e.g. user stories, ERDs, and wireframe)
- Your repository includes a link to the deployed version of your project in the repository `URL` field
- The repository includes a `readme.md` file containing:
  - A description of the project
  - A couple paragraphs about the general approach you took
  - Installation instructions for any dependencies
  - Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles your team had to overcome

---

#### Deployment and functionality

- Your application is deployed to Heroku (hint: use `heroku rename` to give your app a nice URL)
- Cursory use of your app yields no errors that "break" your app
